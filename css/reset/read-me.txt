Different browsers will have default styles for different elements (e.g. Google Chrome vs IE vs Mozilla)
CSS resets will remove these predefined styles from common HTML elements and provide one unified style for all browsers. (Removing margin, sizing, padding, additional styles)

Eric Meyer's reset.css - hard resets all common elements, includes styles for new HTML5 elements (e.g. <header>, <footer>, <section>)

Normalize.css - does not do a hard reset of all common elements, sets common styles for these elements instead. Requires stronger understanding of CSS and awareness of what you want your styles to be.

** you MUST have the reset file at the top of the CSS style sheet (if inline) or link to it before you link your own stylesheet to the HTML**
