Hi!
I have a background in creative advertising and motion graphics, where I've designed for web and television animation, events, photo shoots, installations, digital and print media campaigns, and more.

Then I took a break, moved to a tiny city in Japan where I taught English to awkward teenagers, picked up conversational Japanese to fight my gas company, and started learning programming basics. Fast forward to today, and you have a software engineer with the technical and design chops to bring a spark of creativity to all your engineering needs.

I enjoy cooking ü•ò, playing video games üëæ, tending to a modest plant collection ü™¥, cycling üö≤, and reading science fiction and fantasy books üêâ.
